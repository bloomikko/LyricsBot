# LyricsBot
Twitter bot for getting lyrics from LyricsWikia from a certain artist. The artist can be determined, I used cupcakKe as an example. I've learned Python independently in 2014 but never used it since. I'm an active Twitter user and there are a lot of interesting bots, so I decided to make one myself. Python seemed to be the perfect language for this purpose.

Bot also running at https://twitter.com/cupcakKesays on my Raspberry Pi

**Note:** *cupcakKe's lyrics are very NSFW* ðŸ‘€
